        <p>fresh out of genesis, writing like i’m aeschylus <br>
          tragedy’s my specialty and love is my nemesis <br>
          pardon if i reminisce, remembering Her exodus <br>
          breath slipping i was swift swimming to Her sinking ship <br>
          <br>
          should’ve taken pegasus, peg me incredulous <br>
          legs limping up the last steps of mount olympus <br>
          memory of Her lips was shaded in Her eclipse <br>
          melody of Her curves were captured in Her ellipse <br>
          <br>
          i’m the mathematics of the maddest man <br>
          adding up my maladies, subtracting all my future plans <br>
          planning on having haphazard plots to be the saddest man <br>
          man i am so glad to have happened at all, happily i am <br>
          <br>
          i am so certain of my uncertainty <br>
          open up my curtain and welcome to what burdens me <br>
          burning deep hurting me <br>
          is a thousand degrees of separation from what i used to be <br>
          woe is me, alone to see, alone is free <br>
          <br>
          tragedy’s my specialty and love is my nemesis <br>
          i stay elegant, eloquent until hell insists <br>
          i sell my soul so i can purge me of these curses <br>
          and maybe stay alive and find somebody’s purpose <br>
          <br>
          i poured a glass until even the optimist agreed <br>
          the half given never feels like the half received <br>
          half of me believed happily that we would be <br>
          just a dot in the sky not a world of debris <br>
          <br>
          all i need is a dream <br>
          staring at the sky asking god to believe <br>
          bless my soul, bless my heart, bless the blood that i bleed <br>
          bless the little hands that hold me when the demons are released <br>
          <br>
          needing everything that couldn’t be for free <br>
          free my soul from years of listening to me <br>
          i found a throne in the ozone just to feel the breeze <br>
          when the birds and the bees came bruised at the knees <br>
          <br>
          truth kissed in degrees <br>
          soft hips told me everything i need <br>
          i was lost in the cracks of a memory <br>
          i am lost, i am free <br>

          <br>
          i find solace when speaking these words cease in me <br>
          my mind’s at rest and at last i can rest peacefully <br>
          this people pleasing is masking all of my misery <br>
          i seek the silence through the violence, praying for a decent sleep <br>
          <br>
          find me on a raft in the middle of lake michigan <br>
          calling out for help using riddles and fake signals and <br>
          wait for the bigger ship and they say “oh, not him again” <br>
          sorry for the trouble, i was here last weekend <br>
          <br>
          please send for the spaces that i left, yesterdays <br>
          silhouettes throwing shade at what’s kept <br>
          a little <br>
          love burned through the last cigarette <br>
          in the dark after thoughts never glow to impress <br>
          words rippled in the waves of Her dress <br>
          standing on the shore, i was blind and out of breath <br>
          i guess, <br>
          She never needed what i promised in the end <br>
          we never needed to pretend <br>

        when Her brain and Her body were breaking at the seams <br>
        <br>
        She always taught me how to bleed <br>
        bearing burdens but they couldn't quite coagulate a creed <br>
        i wrapped Her baggage in a bandage but the scars need to breathe <br>
        skies burn a little brighter when you're nestled in the weeds <br>

        i don’t know how to do this, i’m toothless, losing all hope <br>

        lemon lime dreams hiding sweet between the sheets <br>

        i was good at taking what i couldn't keep and <br>

        <br>
        posing my quips as an impotent imp <br>
        limping on figurative legs, losing shit <br>
        head floating lonely, my infinite blimp <br>
        it won’t be a good year, but thanks for the tip <br>
        <br>
        thanks for the key you left under my mat <br>
        i spent the whole summer trying to give it right back <br>
        i hope i wasn’t rude, i hope i wasn’t cruel <br>
        but it felt just right to take different paths <br>
        <br>
        you are beautiful <br>
        you are beautiful <br>
        i am <br>
        i don't know <br>
        something usual <br>
        i am <br>
        blues <br>
        i am blue <br>
        i am blue blooded pools <br>
        under water <br>
        under you <br>

        <p>god only knows the trouble i’ve caused <br>
        god only knows the friends i’ve lost <br>
        god only knows what i only know <br>
        and that’s the pain of being crossed <br>
        <br>
        crossed up and crossed out <br>
        criss-crossed on christ’s cross <br>
        tossed up and tossed out <br>
        lip-locked with earth’s boss <br>
        <br>
        i’m unsettled, rose unpetalled, <br>
        disentangle my mental medals, <br>
        first place - nothing <br>
        last place - something <br>
        someone please help, i’m too sentimental <br>
        <br>
        i’ve made enough room for my own little devil <br>
        he’s not leaving soon, i’m feeling too special <br>
        let me revel, at this level, <br>
        building the devil ten godly temples <br>
        <br>
        amending and repenting all my sins that i’m spending <br>
        sending thoughts and prayers to the hopes that i’m ending <br>
        and in life, this advice that i’m lending <br>
        wish for more, cry for less, life is always pending <br>
        <br>
        perhaps i misspoke about a second ago <br>
        perhaps i missed love by begging for more <br>
        perhaps you knew i was a lesson in “no” <br>
        perhaps you flew bye in blessings, i know <br>
        <br>
        i know i know i can’t please everybody <br>
        i know i know i’m just too melancholy <br>
        <br>
        color me in whatever shade of blue you like <br>
        color me in whatever shade of you you like <br>
        <br>
        i’m blurring all my visions of you ‘cause i know i lost <br>
        i’m burning all these pictures of me ‘cause i know i’m wrong <br>
        who could’ve guessed that feeling better would take this long <br>
        i’m weak i know but maybe one day i could be as strong <br>
        <br>
        as the way that you always were <br>
        i was stuck repeating moments, i never heard <br>
        your pleas for more, your pleas for more <br>
        your pleas for me to change my ways <br>
        <br>
        every single day, i was stuck in myself <br>
        i was blind to Her rays <br>
        <br>
        i was blind to self-destruction <br>
        thought i wasn’t something <br>
        knew i couldn’t muster up the strength to be more than nothing <br>
        <br>
        i’m more than god could ever think of <br>
        but not in the way She would ever ever dream of <br>
        <br>
        my thoughts reach high as a mountain peak does <br>
        that mountain crumbles with a soft touch <br>
        a soft look <br>
        is all is takes to break me down <br>
        <br>
        into past me’s <br>
        tossed around <br>
        buried deep <br>
        under ground <br>
        under Her <br>
        is what’s left of me <br>
        under me <br>
        is what’s left of She <br>
        She never knew <br>
        i was you <br>
        but i knew this for an eternity <br>
        i know <br>
        <br>
        i know i know i can’t please everybody <br>
        i know i know i’m just too melancholy <br>
        <br>
        color me in whatever shade of blue you like <br>
        color me in whatever shade of you you like <br>
        <br>
        my is nose bleeding once again but i should know me, <br>
        i think that is my weary heart escaping from me <br>
        just needs to breathe the cool air like She’s breaking from me <br>
        it’s torn in three and my rosary can’t find comfort in me <br>
        <br>
        my skin is peeling <br>
        i’m kneeling on shattered knee caps <br>
        my tongue is reeling <br>
        i’m feeling like let me relapse <br>
        <br>
        perhaps my spine will spit <br>
        and i will spite my collapse <br>
        or maybe once my nerves will numb, i will finally relax <br>
        <br>
        the sky flashes, my eyes spark <br>
        i’m my shadow in the dark <br>
        i’m my shadow in the dark <br>
        my mind crashes, my hearts stops <br>
        i might fall when god drops <br>
        i might fall when god drops <br>
        <br>
        i might miss planet earth and drift forever on <br>
        i dread the day when She won’t miss me when i’m gone <br>
        i dread the dusk that isn’t followed by a dawn <br>
        i know i dread too much, i know i lost this marathon <br>
        <br>
        i know i know i can’t please everybody <br>
        i know i know i’m just too melancholy <br>
        <br>
        color me in whatever shade of blue you like <br>
        color me in whatever shade of you you like <br>
        <br>
        i know i know i can’t please everybody <br>
        i know i know i’m just too melancholy <br>
        <br>
        lazing on the beach dreaming of sun sets <br>
        setting up dreams of things i haven’t done yet <br>
        probably never will, i don’t have the will <br>
        but i do know how to burn through this cigarette <br>
        <br>
        i do know how to yearn for what i don’t deserve <br>
        i do know how to learn i am not why i hurt <br>
        <br>
        i’m squirming, palms serving up sermons <br>
        legs praising god’s earnings <br>
        toes curling in cursive <br>
        arms raising up workings <br>
        <br>
        of a better man <br>
        smarter man kinder man <br>
        he’s surely better than me <br>
        <br>
        i’m weak in the knees <br>
        soft in the spine <br>
        lofty dreams of a hero <br>
        i gotta rewind <br>
        <br>
        life please slow down <br>
        i’m too old for this now <br>
        heart too cold for Her smile <br>
        eyes too warped to see miles <br>
        <br>
        ahead of me <br>
        that’s a better me <br>
        smarter me kinder me <br>
        <br>
        i’m surely better than i was <br>
        i’m surely better than i was <br>
        <br>
        i’ll say it over and over <br>
        but that doesn’t mean it’s true <br>
        i’ll say it over and over <br>
        but that doesn’t mean it’s true <br>
        doesn’t mean it’s true <br>
        <br>
        here i am taking back roads through black woods <br>
        i’m living life backwards, lost in traffic <br>
        i found myself again lost in madness, <br>
        i had life established as more than tragic <br>
        i’m acting, i’m spazzing <br>
        i’m trapped in a rut not taking action <br>
        <br>
        i’m actually something more than magic <br>
        more than magic <br>
        <br>
        i’m surely better than i was <br>
        i’m surely better than i was <br>
        <br>
        i’m surely better than i was <br>
        i’m surely better than i was <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        i’ll say it over and over <br>
        but that doesn’t mean it’s true <br>
        i’ll say it <button id="over13" type="button" name="button">over</button> and over <br>

        <p><i>i am something usual. a pixel in a gray image on a flickering computer screen. a fleeting judgmental thought that is silenced. <button id="the14" type="button" name="button"><i>the</i></button> yearning for an extra minute of sleep. and it all feels very numb.</i></p>
      </div>

      <div class="pale">
        <p>we are the centers of our universe <br>
        we can’t stop these winters and this truth it hurts <br>
        but we can split these splinters, spit verse after verse <br>
        pursing our lips locked, avoiding the hearse <br>
        <br>
        i once overheard heroes wallowing out <br>
        about how they can’t live up to the sound <br>
        of followers falling into the ground <br>
        and leaving behind no love to be found <br>
        <br>
        taking baby steps to death just like my therapist told me <br>
        faking maybe yesses, i stress that this life is holy, hold please <br>
        my phone’s a little busy, i’m dizzy, and the world is only <br>
        a little insecure, i’m sure, that we are so lonely, hold me <br>
        <br>
        She looked in my eye, all She saw was a pale blue dot <br>
        i looked to the sky and said, “that’s a pretty nice thought” <br>
        <br>
        i used to feel fear, i used to feel the world turn, i used to feel <br>
        but lately i’ve been wandering, wondering if all this is real <br>
        masticated mammaries, masturbated memories <br>
        wish i could remember more than that <br>
        seems a long time ago you told me you would never go <br>
        and i’ve been running from it, from the past <br>
        from the thousand ways to hate the way i said i loved you back <br>
        and your heart keeps beating through the cracks <br>
        and i write to find the dark embrace, <br>
        fill the glass until the fight goes away <br>
        hold the knife close, flow penetrates <br>
        and await <br>
        but i’m sitting on the rim just so i can feel the burn again <br>
        sipping on the holy water, holy ghost in the pen <br>
        got a kid lit sin feeling like a vitamin <br>
        spitting all alone thinking holiness is only them <br>
        only in the dark does a spark feel alive <br>
        flicker in your eye licks the rings in the sky <br>
        i fell asleep in the blanket of your mind <br>
        i fell asleep before you cried <br>
        <br>
        i fell asleep <br>
        i fell asleep <br>
        i fell asleep until you and i knew that we had died <br>
        and this life was not the way that they say it’s supposed to be <br>
        i did not have the thought that love got ahold of me <br>
        maybe once, maybe twice when She would get close to see <br>
        all my faults were all my fault and that’s just speaking honestly <br>
        <br>
        i can’t talk to you any truer than that <br>
        at the end of my line, the extent of my craft <br>
        i am floating away on this rickety <button id="raft15" type="button" name="button">raft</button> <br>
        when i feel a soft touch on my blistering back <br>
        <br>
        She was there, She was there <br>
        with a stare, with a stare <br>
        She told me, “row slowly, and breathe in my air” <br>
        <br>
        She looked in my eye, all She saw was a pale blue dot <br>
        i looked to the sky and said “that’s pretty nice thought” <br>
